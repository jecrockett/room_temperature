        Colorado Republican Party cancelled their caucus tomorrow, so only Democrats

        Jan 4, 2016*, and c) a *registered Democrat*. You\u2019ll also need to grab
        your precinct number for step 2.\n\n2) *Find your caucus location*, i.e. where

        at 6:30 PM tomorrow, 7:00 PM at the latest. Check additional resources for
        what to expect.\n\nNot trying to be partisan \u2014 if the Republican Party
